# SOM-on-country-data
# Countries Clustering using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and KMeans

This project aims to cluster countries based on various socio-economic indicators using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and KMeans clustering. The clustering results are visualized in a 2D grid, providing insights into the similarities between countries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is titled **"Unsupervised Learning on Country Data"** and is available on Kaggle. It includes socio-economic and demographic indicators for approximately 167 countries, such as:
- GDP per capita
- Life expectancy
- Population
- Literacy rates
- Healthcare spending

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze global socio-economic disparities and trends through unsupervised learning techniques, aiding researchers, policymakers, and economists in understanding the similarities and differences among countries.

## Requirements

### Software Requirements

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` (for data handling)
  - `numpy` (for numerical computations)
  - `matplotlib` (for visualization)
  - `sklearn` (for scaling and clustering)
  - `minisom` (for the Self-Organizing Map)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn minisom
